# CGLP Project
This repo is part of a collaboration with Professor Sandholtz from the USC School of International Relations. 

This project parses HTML and PDF court decisions from more than 30 countries in several different languages to extract case ids, court decision dates, and the participants in a case.
Additionally this project uses an implementation of Aho et al.'s efficient string matching algorithm to find references to court decisions from other nations.
